# What is Smartweave?

<br>
SmartWeave is an approach to smart contracts that allows the blockchain to dispense with gas fees and only requires a smart contract’s code to be run as often as it is needed and it doesn't need to be run by every node on the network.

“SmartWeave is a new smart contract language environment built on top of the Arweave network,” Arweave’s Sam Williams told CoinDesk. “It uses this novel type of evaluation called ‘lazy evaluation’ to move the computational burden of smart-contract execution from the nodes in the network to the users of the smart contract.”
